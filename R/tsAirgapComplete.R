#' @title Time series of monthly airline passengers (complete)
#'
#' @description Monthly totals of international airline passengers, 1949 to 1960.
#' This time series provides the truth for the missing values of the \code{\link{tsAirgap}} time series. Thus it is identical
#' to the tsAirgap time series except that no value is missing.
#' 
#' @details The dataset originates from Box and Jenkins (see citation) and is a commonly used example in
#' time series analysis literature.
#' 
#' It characteristics (strong trend, strong seasonal behavior) make it also a great 
#' example for time series imputation.
#' Thus the version with inserted NA gaps was created under the name tsAirgap.
#'
#' In order to use this series for comparing imputation algorithm results,
#' there are two time series provided. One series without missing values, which can
#' be used as ground truth. Another series with NAs, on which the imputation 
#' algorithms can be applied. 
#' 
#' There are the two time series:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item tsAirgap - The time series with NAs.
#'
#'   \item tsAirgapComplete - Time series without NAs.
