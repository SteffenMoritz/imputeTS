# Changes in Version 3.3

Thanks to Sabrina Krys, Kevin Villalobos, Tracy Shen, hezhichao1991, englianhu for bug / issue reporting.
Thanks to RicardaP for fixing documentation error.
Thanks to Ronald Hause for the commit to optimize parameter pass trough from approx to na_interpolation.


* Renamed ggplot_na_intervals to ggplot_na_distribution2

* Updates to ggplot_na_gapsize: Space between the bars adjusted for better optics.
  Added parameters for directly choosing the bar border color and alpha value for
  filling of the bars.
  
* Improved notification message for na_seadec/na_seasplit when find_frequency couldn't find
  a seasonal pattern.

* Corrected error in na_kalman documentation - auto.arima was wrongly described as default parameter choice, while in reality it is StructTS 
  (reported by RicardaP)

* Changes for the error handling. (**These changes got reverted and did not make it into the CRAN release**). For some specific cases the input checks performed by imputeTS stop pipe workflows in their entirety. E.g. a problem when group_by leads to  all NA subsets - which fail the input check and then stop the whole pipe workflow. To prevent this, stop() is only called, when the user supplied imputeTS algorithm parameter options are wrong or misspelled. Unsupported input data will only give a warning() (and do not perform any action on the data). Thus, there is no call to stop(), that cancels the whole pipe workflow.  (issue reported by Sabrina Krys). This works fine, but after closer consideration we figured people fail to notice warnings way too often and thus it is more user friendly to clearly stop with an error for these issues. After all, the users data analysis clearly profits from taking a closer look in these specific cases. If you are anyhow interested in the version without the reverted changes, it can be installed from github with the following command: devtools::install_github("https://github.com/SteffenMoritz/imputeTS/commit/aaf759216b4091e36dee6e8e3a10185ff8f4647b")

* Improved error messages (especially for multivariate inputs) and unit tests for the warnings and errors.

* Corrected typo in 'Input data needs at least x non-NA data points' error message

*  Better parameter pass trough from approx to na_interpolation- Added capability to alter rule for linear extrapolation outside the interval [min(x), max(x)] 
   (commit by Ronald Hause)

* Improved na_interpolation documentation (more information about possible parameter pass 
  through from underlying spline, approx,stinterp functions)

* Additional unit tests

* Moved to Github Actions instead of TravisCI / AppVeyor.

* Bugfix for "Error in optim(init[mask], getLike, method = "L-BFGS-B", lower = rep(0, : L-BFGS-B needs finite values of 'fn'.", which comes for completely constant input to na_kalman e.g. 4,4,4,NA,4,4. (reported by Kevin Villalobos, Tracy Shen, hezhichao1991, englianhu)

* Improved na_seadec documentation (algorithm details)

* Changed R Version requirement in Description to R (>= 3.6) since imported packages like ggtext and also some testthat   tests were already requiring newer versions than the old R (â‰¥ 3.0.1) requirement of imputeTS


# Changes in Version 3.2

Thanks to Mark J. Lamias for bug / issue reporting.
Thanks to Cyrus Mohammadian for bug reporting.
Thanks to Miroslaw Janik for issue reporting. 

* Fix to remove CRAN note - removed not used utils from DESCRIPTION imports

* Minor fix to ggplot_na_distribution (bars end now at max(timeseries)*1.05)

* Typo corrections in statsNA

* Specified ggplot2 (>= 3.3.0) in imports, to prevent errors with older ggplot2 versions (reported by Cyrus Mohammadian)

* Updated na_locf documentation to make behavior of na_remaining parameter more clear (issue reported by Mark J. Lamias)

* ggplot_na_intervals, has now percentages with % sign (e.g. 10%) on y-scale instead of just numbers (e.g. 0,1)
  (suggestion from Miroslaw Janik)
  
* Added some figures and the Cheat Sheet .pptx to .Rbuildignore to avoid CRAN warning about  
  package size. These files and figures were not needed for the CRAN version. 


# Changes in Version 3.1

Thanks to Earo Wang for speedup of plotNA.gapsize.
Special Thanks to Sebastian Gatscha for plotting functions, new na_mean options, new unit tests.

* Speedup for plotNA_gapsize calculation (now renamed ggplot_na_gapsize)  (thx to Earo Wang) 
  
* Added harmonic and geometric mean as option for na_mean

* Removed bug in na_replace - it can now be used with all NA vectors since 
 it requires no minimum of non-NA values (reported by Jan - jmablans)
 
* Improved na.random input check (usable with all NA input now if upper and lower bound
  parameters are explicitly set to numeric values)

* Additional unit tests for the plotting functions

* Additional unit tests for the all imputation functions (testing all NA input)

  compatibility with other ts objects

   style guidelines. The old function names will still work for a while,
   but give a warning.

   stop("Wrong parameter 'option' given. Value must be either 'linear', 'spline' or 'stine'.")
   (reported by Breza)

* Fixed spelling mistakes in na.seadec and na.seasplit (reported by shreydesai)

* Fixed bug with na.random() output (reported by Jim Maas)

# Changes in Version 1.7
  
  * Enabled usage of multivariate input (data.frame, mts, matrix,...) for all imputation 
    functions except na.remove. This means users do not have to loop through all columns 
    by themselfes anymore if they want to use the package with multivariate data. The
    imputation itself is still performend in univariate manner (column after column). 
  
  * Improved compatibility with different advanced time series objects like zoo and xts.
    Using the imputation functions with these time series objects should be possible now. 
    These series will not be explicitly named as possible input in the user documentation.
    Absence of errors can not be guaranteed. However, there are no known issues yet.
