ggplot_na_pattern(
  x,
  limit = 10,
  include_total = TRUE,
  ranked_by = "occurrence",
  color_occurrence = "indianred",
  color_total = "steelblue",

}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric Vector (\code{\link[base]{vector}}) or Time Series
(\code{\link[stats]{ts}}) object containing NAs. This is the only mandatory
parameter - all other parameters are only needed for adjusting the plot appearance.}

\item{limit}{Specifies how many of the most common gap sizes are shown in
the plot.Default is 10. So only the 10 most often occurring gapsizes will
be shown. If more or all present gap sizes should be displayed, the limit needs
to be increased. Since this might add a lot of additional data, having
parameter  \code{orientation} set to 'horizontal' avoids overlaps in the axis
labels.}

\item{include_total}{When set to TRUE the total NA count for a gapsize is
included in the plot (total = number occurrence x gap size).
E.g. if a gapsize of 3 occurs 10 times, this means this gap size makes
up for 30 NAs in total. This can be a good indicator of the
overall impact of a gapsize.}

\item{ranked_by}{Should the results be sorted according to the number of
occurrence or total resulting NAs for a gapsize. Total resulting NAs
are calculated by (total = number occurrence x gap size).
\itemize{
\item{"occurrence" - Sorting by 'number of occurrence' of a gap size}

\item{"total" - Sorting by 'total resulting NAs' of a gap size}
}

The default setting is "occurrence".}

\item{color_occurrence}{Defines the Color for the Bars of
'number of occurrence'.}

\item{color_total}{Defines the color for the bars of
'total resulting NAs'.}

\item{title}{Title of the Plot.}

\item{subtitle}{Subtitle of the Plot.}

\item{xlab}{Label for x-Axis.}

\item{ylab}{Label for y-Axis.}

\item{legend}{If TRUE a legend is added at the bottom.}

\item{orientation}{Can be either 'vertical' or 'horizontal'. Defines
if the bars are plotted vertically or horizontally. For large amounts
of different gap sizes horizontal illustration is favorable (also see
parameter \code{limit}).}

\item{label_occurrence}{Defines the label assigned to 'number of occurrence'
in the legend.}

\item{label_total}{Defines the label assigned to 'total resulting NAs'
in the legend.}

\item{theme}{Set a Theme for ggplot2. Default is ggplot2::theme_linedraw().
(\code{\link[ggplot2]{theme_linedraw})}}

\value{
The output is a \code{\link[ggplot2]{ggplot2}} object that can be
further adjusted by using the ggplot syntax

\description{
Visualize Patterns in NA occurrences. E.g. weakly, ...,..
}
\details{
This plotting function can be used to visualize the length of
the NA gaps (NAs in a row) in a time series. It shows a ranking of which
gap sizes occur most often. This ranking can be ordered by the number
occurrence of the gap sizes or by total resulting NAs for this gap size
(occurrence * gap length). A NA-gap of 3 occuring 10 times means 30 total
resulting NAs.

A resulting plot can for example be described like this:
a 2 NA-gap (2 NAs in a row) occurred  27 times,
a 9 NA-gap (9 NAs in a row) occurred  11 times,
a 27 NA-gap (27 NAs in a row) occurred  1 times, ...

The only really needed parameter for this function is x (the univariate
time series with NAs that shall be visualized). All other parameters
are solely for altering the appearance of the plot.

As long as the input is univariate and numeric the function also takes
data.frame, tibble, tsibble, zoo, xts as an input.

The plot can be adjusted to your needs via the function parameters.
Additionally for more complex adjustments, the output can also be
adjusted via ggplot2 syntax. This is possible, since the output
of the function is a ggplot2 object. Also take a look at the Examples
to see how adjustments are made.
