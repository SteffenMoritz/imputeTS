\title{Print Statistics about Missing Values}
\usage{
statsNA(x, bins = 4, print_only = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric Vector (\code{\link{vector}}) or
Time Series (\code{\link{ts}}) object containing NAs}

\item{bins}{Split number for bin stats. Number of bins the time series gets
divided into. For each bin information about amount/percentage of missing
values is printed. Default value is 4 - what means stats about the
1st,2nd,3rd,4th quarter of the time series are shown.}

\item{print_only}{Choose if the function Prints or Returns.
For print_only = TRUE the function has no return value and just prints out
missing value stats. If print_only is changed to FALSE, nothing is printed
and the function returns a list.Print gives a little bit more information,
since the returned list does not include "Stats for Bins"
and "overview NA series"}
}
\value{
A \code{\link{list}} containing the stats. Beware: Function gives
only a return value if print_only = FALSE.
}
\description{
Print summary stats about the distribution of
missing values in a univariate time series.
}
\details{
Prints the following information about the missing values in the time series:
\itemize{
\item{"Length of time series" - Number of observations in the time series (including NAs)}
\item{"Number of Missing Values" - Number of missing values in the time series}
\item{"Percentage of Missing Values" - Percentage of missing values in the time series}
\item{"Number of Gaps" - Number of NA gaps (consisting of one or more consecutive NAs) in the time series}
\item{"Average Gap Size" - Average size of consecutive NAs for the NA gaps in the time series}
\item{"Stats for Bins" - Number/percentage of missing values for the split into bins }
\item{"Longest NA gap" - Longest series of consecutive missing values (NAs in a row) in the time series }
\item{"Most frequent gap size" - Most frequent occurring series of missing values in the time series}
\item{"Gap size accounting for most NAs" - The series of consecutive missing values that accounts for most missing values overall in the time series}
\item{"Overview NA series" - Overview about how often each series of consecutive missing values occurs. Series occurring 0 times are skipped}
}
It is furthermore, important to note, that you are able to choose whether
the function returns a list or prints the information only.
(see description of parameter "print_only")

\examples{
# Example 1: Print stats about the missing data in tsNH4
statsNA(tsNH4)

# Example 2: Return list with stats about the missing data in tsAirgap
statsNA(tsAirgap, print_only = FALSE)

# Example 3: Same as example 1, just written with pipe operator
tsNH4 \%>\% statsNA()
