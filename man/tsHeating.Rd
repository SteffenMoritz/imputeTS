\description{
Time series of a heating systems supply temperature. Measured from 18.11.2013 - 05:12:00 to 13.01.2015 - 15:08:00 in 1 minute steps.
This time series contains missing values. In the package included is also the \code{\link{tsHeatingComplete}} time series providing the true values for the
missing values.
}
\details{
The time series originates from the GECCO Industrial Challenge 2015.
This Challenge was about "Recovering missing information in heating system operating data".
Goal was to impute missing values in heating system sensor data as accurate as possible.
(\doi{10.5281/zenodo.3884899})

In order to use this series for comparing imputation algorithm results,
there are two time series provided. One series without missing values, which can
be used as ground truth. Another series with NAs, on which the imputation
algorithms can be applied. The NAs thereby were inserted according to patterns
found in similar time series.

There are the two time series:
\itemize{
\item tsHeating - The time series with NAs.

\item tsHeatingComplete - Time series without NAs.
