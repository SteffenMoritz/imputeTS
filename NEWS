Changes in Version 1.6
  
  o Added several things for unit tests with pkg 'testthat'
  
  o Added unit tests for every function
  
  o Internal preCheck function checks now that input length > 1
  

Changes in Version 1.6
  
  o Added github links to description file
  
  o Added citation file
  
  o Updated Readme (badges for travis ci and cran status)
  
  o Fix in documentation for na.interpolation 
   (due to outdated descriptions)
   
  o Fix in documentation plotNA.distribution / plotNA.distributionBar
    (due to interchanged descriptions)
    
  o Added references to used packages in na.kalman and na.interpolation documentation


Changes in Version 1.5

  o Allows now also numeric vectors as input

  o Removed na.identifier parameter for all functions (too error prone, better handled 
    individually by the user)

  o Minor changes in na.interpolation with option = "stine"
  
  o Added na.ma imputation function

  o Replaced "data" in all function parameters with the more common "x"

  o Improvent of all code examples

  o Renamed heating/heatingComplete dataset to tsHeating/tsHeatingComplete

  o Renamed nh4/nh4Complete dataset to tsNH4/tsNH4Complete

  o Added tsAirgap / tsAirgapComplete datasets

  o Improved imputeTS-package documentation

  o Added na.kalman imputation function

  o Added README.md function

  o Added statsNA function

  o Added plotNA.gapsize function
  
  o Renamed vis.imputations to plotNA.imputations

  o Renamed vis.barMissing to plotNA.distributionBar

  o Renamed vis.missing to plotNA.distribution
  
  o Fixed issues with parameter pass trough and legend for
    all plotting functions
    
  o Improved dataset documentation 



Changes in Version 0.4

  o Update of vis.differences (better looking plot now)
  
  o Added vis.missing to visualize the distribution of missing data in a time series
  
  o Added vis.barMissing, which is especially suited to visualize missing data in very huge ts
  
  o Update na.interpolate (added Stineman interpolation and enabled ... parameter 
    for all interpolation algortihms to pass through parameters to the underlying functions)


Changes in Version 0.3

  o Added two datasets of sensor data
  
  o vis.differences for plotting differences between real and imputed values

  

Changes in Version 0.2

  o Removed internal functions from visable package documentation

  o Added additional algorithms: na.seasplit and na.seadec
  
  o internal function for algorithm selection
  
 

Changes in Version 0.1

  o Created initial version of imputeTS package for univariate time series imputation

  o added the simple imputation functions: na.locf, na.mean, na.random, na.interpolation, 
    na.replace

  o added na.remove function for removing all NAs from a time series
